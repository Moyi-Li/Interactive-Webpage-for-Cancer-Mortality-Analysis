## Project Overview:

This project aims to provide a report that contains an overall summary and trends of the four specific cancers: breast cancer, larynx cancer, liver cancer, and myeloma cancer. It focuses on whether different states and sex relate to the increase/decrease in the cancer population in America, as well as how these two factors affect the cancer population. Through this project, we hope to help viewers better understand cancer trends through these years and their distribution of it. We also hope to grow awareness of what factors might affect the higher possibility of specific cancers and provide a resource for health officials to further enhance their research.
